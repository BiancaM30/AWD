This website was created as part of the **Adaptive Web Design** course. The theme assigned for this project was **Creativity**, and the goal was to build a fully responsive and adaptive single-word website.

The site explores the **neuroscience of creativity**, inspired by research from Arne Dietrich and others, covering both cognitive and emotional dimensions. From deliberate invention like Edison’s to spontaneous artistic bursts, the project presents creativity as a whole-brain phenomenon with rich contextual variations.
